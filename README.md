# KOAuth Sync - OAuth 1.0a Provider & Consumer Library in Scala

**Same as [koauth](https://github.com/kovacshuni/koauth) but not in asynchronous mode.
All the methods are sync calls. All outputs are direct types, not Futures.**

This library aids calculations according to the [OAuth 1.0a](http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/)
specifications for both HTTP server and client.

* Provider library: Verifying and responding to HTTP requests according to specifications.
* Consumer library: Complementing HTTP requests to be sent with OAuth parameters.

See the rest of the README in [the original project](https://github.com/kovacshuni/koauth).
